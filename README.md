# q-tensor-saves

## Introduction

This is a repository (really, *deposit*ory) for solution visualizations generated by Andrew Hicks' **q-tensor-3d** code. Once working, we will include files generated by Heldt, Liu, and Spasov's **q-tensor-2d** code.

To view these solutions, we recommend to 
  1. place the **vis** folder and **vis.pvd** file in the same directory, then
  2. open the **vis.pvd** file in Paraview.

| Abbreviation | Expansion            | Meaning |
| ------------ | -----------------    | --- |
| gc           | great circle         | initial condition of the great circle of the shell |
| tet          | tetrahedron          | initial condition of the tetrahedron inscribed in a shell |
| hm           | homeotropic          | homeotropic anchoring conditions, namely w0 = 10.0, w1 = w2 = 0 |
| pd           | planar degenerate    | planar degenerate anchoring conditions, namely w0 = 0, w1 = w2 = 10.0 |
| tau#         | tau = #              | tau, the twist term, also denoted q0, equals # |
| sliced       | sliced               | the initial condition is sliced such that exactly 4 tau+1/2 defects form |
| w            | anchoring constant   | the weak anchoring constants, either w0 with w1=w1=0, or w1=w2 with w0=0 |
