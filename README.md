# q-tensor-saves

This is a repository (really, *deposit*ory) for solution visualizations generated by Andrew Hicks' **q-tensor-3d** code. Once working, we will include files generated by Heldt, Liu, and Spasov's **q-tensor-2d** code.

To view these solutions, we recommend to 
  1. place the **vis** folder and **vis.pvd** file in the same directory, then
  2. open the **vis.pvd** file in Paraview.
