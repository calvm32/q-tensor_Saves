# q-tensor-saves

This is a repository (really, *deposit*ory) for solution visualizations generated by Andrew Hicks' q-tensor-3d code. Once working, we will include files generated by Heldt, Liu, and Spasov's code.

To view these solutions, we recommend to place the **vis** folder and **vis.pvd** file in the same directory, then open the latter in Paraview.
